## Welcome to my CodeCrush where I showcase my talents as a HackHound and a RepoRanger. 🔥
I am currently in my pre-final year at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology pursuing a BE in Computer Engineering. I have developed a keen interest in Data Science. Especially in fields of NLP, Time Series, Prediction Models and Computer Vision. I am well versed in C++, C and Python. I am still building my portfolio and hope to add tons of projects soon. Thank you for visiting my GITHUB! 😄✨
